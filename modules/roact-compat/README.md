# roact-compat
A thin compatibility layer connecting Roact 1.4.0 to the new roact alignment effort (often referred to as "Roact 17").

This does _not_ match an upstream package. Its purpose is to encapsulate any deviations whose sole purpose is to provide compatibility with production Roact during the transition.
